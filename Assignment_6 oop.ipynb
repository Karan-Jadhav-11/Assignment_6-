    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    This refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. It helps in hiding the internal details of how an object works and exposing only what is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (base class or superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Abstraction: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they possess. It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It provides a way for different classes to implement the same method name but with different functionality. This enables flexibility in code design and enhances code readability and maintainability."
